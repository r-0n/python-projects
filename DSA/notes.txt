Algorithmic thinking: 
    A way of solving problems that involves breaking a problem down 
    into input & output along with a distinct steps that solves the problem
    from input to output.

Linear Search
Binary Search
Time & Space complexity
    Big O

Recursion & space complexity


Arrays:
    Access and read values
    search for an arbituary values
    Insert values at any point into the structure
    Delete values 

    linked-lists: a linear DS where each element is stored
        in nodes.
            Nodes have:
                the data 
                a reference to the next node in the list,
    Implemented a linklist data structure
                
The Merge Algorithm:
    merge sort
